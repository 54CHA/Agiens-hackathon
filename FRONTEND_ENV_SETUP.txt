FRONTEND ENVIRONMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in your project root (same level as package.json)

2. Add the following content:

VITE_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_9101k119eeg7fht83hcw0aq1wbzr

3. Save the file

Note: This is optional since the agent ID is also hardcoded as a fallback in the App.tsx file.
