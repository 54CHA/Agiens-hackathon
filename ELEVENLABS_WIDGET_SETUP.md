# ElevenLabs Widget Integration - Simple Setup Guide

## ✅ What We've Done

Successfully integrated the **official ElevenLabs Conversational AI Widget** into your chat application!

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Official Widget**: Uses ElevenLabs' official widget (much more reliable than custom implementation)
2. **Auto-Positioning**: Widget appears in bottom-right corner
3. **Independent Operation**: Widget handles all voice recognition and AI conversation independently
4. **Zero Backend Complexity**: No custom WebSocket or API management needed

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Frontend (.env.local):**
```bash
# ElevenLabs Agent ID (optional - fallback is hardcoded)
VITE_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_9101k119eeg7fht83hcw0aq1wbzr
```

**Backend (.env):**
```bash
# Updated with correct agent ID
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_9101k119eeg7fht83hcw0aq1wbzr
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   npm run dev
   
   # Backend (if needed for other features)

   ```

2. **Use the voice assistant**:
   - Look for the ElevenLabs widget in the **bottom-right corner**
   - Click to start voice conversation
